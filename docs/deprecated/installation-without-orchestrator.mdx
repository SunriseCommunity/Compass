# Installation - Without Orchestrator

This section will help you set up Sunrise server on your local environment.

:::warning
This installation guide was in use before the [Solar System](https://github.com/SunriseCommunity/Solar-System) was introduced. **It is now deprecated and not recommended for production use.**


### **Please refer to the new [Installation](./installation) guide for the recommended way to set up the server.**

You can still use this guide if you are interested in the old setup process or if you are running a development environment.
:::

We are going to set up "Production" ready environment, which means we will use Docker to run the server and other components.

If you are more interested in development setup, please refer to the [Contributing](../contributing) section.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): For running the server and other components.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): For cloning the repositories.
- [Database Viewer](https://dbeaver.io/): For managing server database.
  You can use any database viewer you like, but we recommend DBeaver for its ease of use.

  It will be used to give you initial administration privileges to your account. After which everything can be handled in the chat/web interface.

- [Text Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Optional, but recommended. But you can use any text editor you like.

Docker will do the heavy lifting for you, so you don't need to worry about installing any technologies like Redis, MySQL, Grafana, etc.

# Getting Started

## Cloning the Repositories

First, we need to clone the repositories of the components we will be using.
Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SunriseCommunity/Sunrise
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SunriseCommunity/Observatory
```

(Optional) If you want to use the web interface, you can also clone the Sunset repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SunriseCommunity/Sunset
```

## Update `hosts` File

To access the server using an internal domain, we need to update the `hosts` file on your machine.

On Windows, you can find the `hosts` file at `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`.  
On Linux, you can find it at `/etc/hosts`.

Add the following line to the `hosts` file:

```md
... (rest of the file)

# Sunrise Web Section

127.0.0.1 sunrise.local
127.0.0.1 api.sunrise.local

# Sunrise osu! Section

127.0.0.1 osu.sunrise.local
127.0.0.1 a.sunrise.local
127.0.0.1 c.sunrise.local
127.0.0.1 assets.sunrise.local
127.0.0.1 cho.sunrise.local
127.0.0.1 c4.sunrise.local
127.0.0.1 b.sunrise.local
```

:::warning
Don't forget to save the file after editing it.

## Creating Self-Signed Certificates

### Using online generator (recommended)

You can use an online generator to create self-signed certificates.
We recommend using [Devglan's Self-Signed Certificate Generator](https://www.devglan.com/online-tools/generate-self-signed-cert) with the following settings:

- **Common Name (CN)**: `sunrise.local`
- **Email**: `sunrise@mail.com`
- **Validity**: `3650` (10 years)
- **Signing Algorithm**: `SHA256`
- **Key Size**: `4096 bit`

![Online Config](/img/ssl-online.png)

After generating the certificate, click "Download All" button to download the certificate and private key.

Now, generate a PKCS12 file (PFX) from the downloaded files using any online converter or using OpenSSL.

We will use [SSL Trust PFX File Generator](https://www.ssltrust.com.au/ssl-tools/pfx-file-generator) for this.

Upload the downloaded certificate (`certificate.cer`) and private key file (`privateKey.key`) and click "Create / Download PFX File" button.

This will generate a PFX file `certificate.pfx`, rename it to `sunrise.pfx` and move it to the `/Sunrise` directory.

```bash title="Final Directory Structure"
Sunrise/
...
├── sunrise.pfx
...
Observatory/
Sunset/
```

After which, you can double-click on the `certificate.cer` file to install it to the Trusted Root Certification Authorities store, or run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
certutil -addstore -f "ROOT" certificate.cer
```

### Using OpenSSL (advanced)

If you prefer to use OpenSSL, you can create self-signed certificates using the following commands.

Generate a self-signed certificate for the domain sunrise.local by running the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -days 3650 -nodes -keyout sunrise.local.key -out sunrise.local.crt -subj "/CN=sunrise.local" -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:sunrise.local,DNS:*.sunrise.local,IP:10.0.0.1"
```

Convert the certificate to the PKCS12 format (for ASP.Net) by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
openssl pkcs12 -export -out sunrise.pfx -inkey sunrise.local.key -in sunrise.local.crt -password pass:password
```

Move the generated `sunrise.pfx` file to the `/Sunrise` directory.

```bash title="Final Directory Structure"
Sunrise/
...
├── sunrise.pfx
...
Observatory/
Sunset/
```

Import the certificate to the Trusted Root Certification Authorities store by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
certutil -addstore -f "ROOT" sunrise.local.crt
```

## Configuring Sunrise

Now that we have the certificate, we need to configure the Sunrise server to use it.

Create the file `Sunrise.Server/appsettings.Production.json` and fill it following the `Sunrise.Server/appsettings.Production.json.example` example file.

Set up the beatmap manager by following the instructions in the section below.

:::note How to set up Observatory?

Create a `.env` file as a copy of the `.env.example` file in the `/Observatory` directory.

Optionally, fill `BANCHO_CLIENT_ID` and `BANCHO_CLIENT_SECRET` with your own values, which you can get from the [osu! website](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/account/edit).

Fill `IGNORE_RATELIMIT_KEY` with any string you like, it will be used to bypass the rate limit for the Sunrise server.

Your `.env` file should look like this:

```env
...

PORT=3333 # Make sure this port is not used by any other service and will match the `ObservatoryUrl` in the Sunrise configuration.

BANCHO_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
BANCHO_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret

IGNORE_RATELIMIT_KEY=your_ignore_ratelimit_key_for_observatory

...
```

After that, you can run the Observatory using Docker:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

You can check `http://localhost:3333` to see if the Observatory is running.

:::

After setting up the beatmap manager, update the `Sunrise.Server/appsettings.Production.json` file as the following:

```json
{
  "General": {
    "WelcomeMessage": "You can update this message to anything you like!", // This is the message that will be displayed to players when they connect to the server.
    "WebDomain": "your-server-domain.com", // This should be your online domain if you are planning to host the server online.
    "IgnoreBeatmapRanking": false, // Treats all beatmaps as ranked, regardless of their actual status.
    ...
    "UseCustomBackgrounds": true, // If true, the server will use custom backgrounds for the main menu. You can place them in the `Data/SeasonalBackgrounds/` directory.
    ...
    "ObservatoryApiKey": "your_ignore_ratelimit_key_for_observatory", // This should match the `IGNORE_RATELIMIT_KEY` in the Observatory `.env` file.
    "ObservatoryUrl": "host.docker.internal:3333", // This should match the `PORT` in the Observatory `.env` file.
    ...
    "CountryChangeCooldownInDays": 90, // The cooldown for changing the country of a player. Set to 0 to disable.
  },
  "BeatmapHype": {
    "UserHypesWeekly": 10, // The number of hypes a user will get every week. (will not get above this limit)
    "HypesToStartHypeTrain": 2, // The number of hypes required to start a hype train.
    "AllowMultipleHypeFromSameUser": false // If true, users can hype the same beatmap multiple times.
  },
  ...
  "Bot": {
    "Username": "Sunshine Bot", // The username of the bot that will be used to interact with the server.
    "Prefix": "!" // The prefix that will be used to interact with the bot.
  },
  ...
  "API": {
    ...
    "TokenSecret": "ReplaceMeWithSomething" // This is the secret used to sign the API tokens. Make sure to change it to something unique.
  }
}
```

## Running the Server

Now that we have everything set up, we can run the server.

You can run the server using Docker by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

This will start the server and all the components in detached mode.

:::tip
Your final docker setup should look like this:

![](/img/docker.png)
:::

After which you should be able to test connection to the server using `https://cho.sunrise.local` url in your browser. You should see the face of a beatuful mister.

## Accessing the Server

### osu! Client

Add a launch argument `-devserver sunrise.local` to your osu! shortcut.

After that, you can launch the osu! client and should be able to connect to the server.

### Web Interface

If you have cloned the Sunset repository, we will briefly cover how to run it.

First, make sure you have created the `.env.local` file as a copy of the `.env.local.example` file in the `/Sunset` directory and filled it with your values.

:::warning
Make sure to set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_DOMAIN` to `sunrise.local` to match the server domain you set in the Sunrise configuration.
And don't forget to add `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` to disable SSL verification for the local development environment.
:::

Then, you can run the Sunset web interface using Docker by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

After which you should be able to access the web interface at `http://localhost:3090`.
