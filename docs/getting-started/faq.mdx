# Frequently Asked Questions

This section will cover some of the most common questions about Sunrise, its features, and some troubleshooting tips.

## How do I set up the server?

You can find the setup guide in the [Installation](./installation) section of the documentation. It covers everything from prerequisites to running the server.

## How do I contribute to the project?

You can find the contribution guidelines in the [Contributing](./contributing) section of the documentation.

## How do I report a bug or request a feature?

You can report bugs or request features by creating an issue on the related GitHub repository or using the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/BjV7c9VRfn).

## How can I reset the server?

Just remove all tables from the database, remove `Data` directory with a copy of `Data.Tests`, and run the server again. It will recreate all tables and populate them with default data.

## I did changes to the database, but they don't apply!

You likely have a cache issue. The server caches some data to improve performance, so if you make changes directly to the database, they might not be reflected immediately.

Use `!flushcache` chat command to flush the cache. This will force the server to fetch the data from the database.

## Can I use Akatsuki PP system?

**No.** The server uses its own PP system, which is based on the original osu! PP system. It is designed to be compatible with the original osu! client and provides a consistent experience across different servers.

## Can I use bancho.py frontends + Sunrise? Can I use bancho.py server + Sunset?

**No.** The server is designed to work with its own frontends and backends. The API is not compatible with bancho.py, and the server does not support bancho.py frontends.

## Can I use the server without Docker?

Yes, it was even done before by some users, but it's not recommended purely because of the complexity of the setup and the need to manage dependencies manually.

## Can I rollback to pre CSR (Combo Scale Removal) PP system?

Not recommended, but we heard that some users succeeded by downgrading `rosu-pp-js` to a major version before 3.0.0.

```bash title="In the Observatory directory"
bun add rosu-pp-js@^2 # You need to have bun installed

docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d --build --force-recreate
```

## Where can I get `BANCHO_CLIENT_ID` and `BANCHO_CLIENT_SECRET`?

You can get `BANCHO_CLIENT_ID` and `BANCHO_CLIENT_SECRET` by registering your application on the [osu! API](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/account/edit).

![2](/img/bancho-2.png)

![3](/img/bancho-3.png)

You can fill in the `Application Callback URLs` field with any value, as it is not used by the server.

## How can I recalculate users PP?

It's generally not recommended to recalculate users PP frequently, but is recommended to do it after you update the server or to keep up with the bancho's beatmaps changes.

You can do it by running the following command from the admin account to the server's bot:

```bash title="In the game chat. Please wait for the command to finish before sending another one."
!recalculatescores all 0 false
!recalculateusergrades all false
!recalculateuserstats all false
```

This will recalculate all users scores, grades and stats. It may take a while, depending on the number of users and scores in the database.

You can change all `false` values to `true` to set the server in the maintenance mode, which will prevent users from playing while the recalculation is in progress.

## How can I check bot's commands?

You can check the bot's commands by running the following command in the game chat:

```bash title="In the game chat"
!help
```

## Do I need to update hosts file or/and certificate if I would like to use not local domain?

No, you don't need to update the hosts file or the certificate if you want to use a different domain.

Just make sure you are using a reverse proxy (like Nginx or Caddy) to forward requests to the server, and make it use the correct certificate and domain instead.

:::note
With the current setup, you may need to change the `Sunrise` port from `443` to any other port (example: `8443`), as the reverse proxy will try to bind to port `443` by default.

You can do it by changing the `ports` value in the `Sunrise/docker-compose.yml` file.

```yml
name: osu-sunrise
services:
  sunrise:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8443:443"
      ...
```

Following with the rebuild command:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d --build --force-recreate
```

:::

## I get errors about sending requests a little too fast in the game, what should I do?

Firstly, make sure you are set up the same `IGNORE_RATELIMIT_KEY` (Observatory) and `ObservatoryApiKey` (Sunrise) in their configuration files.

If you are still getting errors, you can try to update values in `API.RateLimit` section of the sunrise config file as follows:

```json
{
   ...
   "API": {
      "RateLimit": {
         "CallsPerWindow": 60, -> Number of calls allowed per window, the higher the number, the more requests user can send.
         "Window": 30 -> After which time in seconds the rate limit resets. The lower the value, the more often the rate limit resets.
      },
   }
}
```

:::warning
Be careful with increasing these values, as it can lead to server overload and performance issues.

This **can** lead to your server being restricted or even banned by osu! or beatmap mirrors, so update these values at your own risk.
:::

## How do I update the server?

To update the server, you can follow these steps for all components you wish to update:

1. Stop the server if it's running.
2. Pull the latest changes from the GitHub repository.

```bash
git fetch
git pull
```

3. Rebuild the server using the docker compose command:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d --build --force-recreate
```

This should update all components to the latest version.
