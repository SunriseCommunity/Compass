## üìù About

This is the documentation for the [Sunrise](https://github.com/SunriseCommunity/Sunrise) - osu! server (codebase, not [deployment](https://sunrize.uk)), written fully from ground up in C#.

This documentation is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), and as you noticed, named as 'Compass'.  
We chose this name because it represents guidance and direction, which is what this documentation aims to provide.

## ‚úÖ What you will find here

- **Getting Started**: Learn how to set up and run the Sunrise server.
- **Contributing**: Guidelines for contributing to the Sunrise Community projects.
- **FAQ**: Frequently Asked Questions about the server and setup process.

## ‚ùå What you won't find here

- **Game Mechanics Explanation**: This documentation does not cover osu! game mechanics. For that, refer to the [osu! wiki](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/).
  :::warning
  You are expected to have basic knowledge of osu! and its mechanics, as this documentation does not cover those aspects.
  :::

- **How to change thing X to Y**: This documentation does not provide step-by-step guides for changing specific features.
- **Server Hosting**: This documentation does not cover how to host the server on your own infrastructure. _At least for now._

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Final Notes

This documentation is written after multiple instances of confusion and questions from the community.

We hope it serves as a comprehensive guide for both new and experienced developers.
