---

This documentation is built using [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/), and as you noticed, named as 'Compass'.  
We chose this name because it represents guidance and direction, which is what this documentation aims to provide.


## ✅ What you will find here

- **Getting Started**: Learn how to set up and run the Sunrise server.
- **Contributing**: Guidelines for contributing to the Sunrise Community projects.
- **FAQ**: Frequently Asked Questions about the server and setup process.
- **Server Hosting**: This documentation is based on the [Solar System Orchestrator](https://github.com/SunriseCommunity/Solar-System) and covers how to host the server to the internet.

## ❌ What you won't find here

- **Game Mechanics Explanation**: This documentation does not cover osu! game mechanics. For that, refer to the [osu! wiki](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/).
  :::warning
  You are expected to have basic knowledge of osu! and its mechanics, as this documentation does not cover those aspects.
  :::

- **How to change thing X to Y**: This documentation does not provide step-by-step guides for changing specific features.
- **How to migrate from other osu! server frameworks**: Although we would like to cover this, but for now there is no such functionality. Hopefully in the future we are able to implement this.

## ❤️ Final Notes

This documentation is written after multiple instances of confusion and questions from the community.

We hope it serves as a comprehensive guide for both new and experienced developers.
