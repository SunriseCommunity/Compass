For now this section is empty, but we plan to cover how to contribute to the Sunrise project in the future.

If you want to contribute now, you can check ask us directly what's need to be done in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/BjV7c9VRfn) or create an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SunriseCommunity/Sunrise).

We are always looking for help with the development of the server, so if you are interested in contributing, please don't hesitate to contact us. We are happy to help you get started and guide you through the process.
