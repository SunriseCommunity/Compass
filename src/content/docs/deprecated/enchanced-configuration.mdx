This section will cover enhanced configuration of the server, which were previously not possible with the admin panel.

## Update your own privileges (Using direct database change)

Before we can access the admin panel, we need to update our own privileges. This is currently done by updating server's database directly.

For the sake of simplicity, we will use the [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) database management tool, but you can use any other tool that supports MySQL databases.

<Steps>
1. Open DBeaver.
2. Connect to your database following the instructions below
   :::note
   While the credentials used here are the default ones, they can be different depending on your setup. Please check the `.env` file for the correct credentials.
   :::
   - **Host**: `localhost`
   - **Port**: `3306` (use `3308` for development builds)
   - **Database**: `sunrise`
   - **Username**: `root`
   - **Password**: `root`

3. Open the `Database/sunrise/user` table.
4. Find your user in the list, and double-click on it's `Privilege` value.
5. Update it to the new value depending on the privileges you want to have. For example, to have admin privileges, set it to `8`.
   <Aside title="Privilege Levels and how to calculate them">
   To calculate the privilege level, you should sum the values of the privileges you want to grant.

   Current privileges are:

   - `0` - User
   - `1` - Supporter
   - `2` - Bat (Beatmap Approval Team)
   - `8` - Administrator
   - `16` - Developer
   - `512` - Super User (Can use server maintenance commands)

   For example, if you want to grant Bat and Administrator privileges, you would sum `2` (Bat) and `8` (Administrator), resulting in `10`.

   </Aside>

6. Click on the `Apply cell changes` button (or press `Ctrl + S`).
7. Changes will be applied during a minute or so, and you will be able to access the admin panel.
